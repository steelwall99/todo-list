Implementation plan for a to do list BASH application.

I intend to build a script that allows me to compile a list that can be added to,
edited, marked individualy as complete, and provide a list of all tasks still left to do.

a design artifact would be the applications use case, being that in the process of creating thius application, i will learn how to create a script, provide utility to me in the form oof a functioning to do list, and practice version control via git commits and pushes.

I will own the code given that I created it from scratch.

changes will be applied via git commits and pushes to this projects git repository.
