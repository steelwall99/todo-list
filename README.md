# todo-list
a collection of my struggle to make a functional to do list.

run ./add.sh to add an item to the list
youll be asked "what items do you want to add" place your input and press enter

to check what is on the todo list run ./list.sh
this will display alist of the items on the to do list with a number next to it

to remove somthing from the list run ./remove.sh
when promted "hat item number do you want to remove" just as with the add script, input the item number you want to remove and hit enter.
